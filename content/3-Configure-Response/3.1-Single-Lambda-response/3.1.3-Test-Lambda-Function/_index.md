<!-- #### Test Lambda Function: -->

In this step we will test the Lambda Function that created previously.

1. Review the comments on the code to understand what it's doing.

    - Review the main steps on the code. Note: this is just an example, more actions could be added.
    - The code has several print functions that you can leave enabled to see the contents on CloudWatch Logs, or you can comment them out.

2. Create **test event** for Lambda function

    - In the same _Function code editor_,  
    - Select **Analyses**.
    - Select the **Analysis** you want to delete.
    - Click **Delete**.
